# Mailgun Kubernetes operator

The Mailgun Kubernetes Custom Resources Operator allows users to manage Mailgun domains, webhooks, and routes directly within a Kubernetes cluster. If the external-dns operator is also installed, it automatically verifies domain DNS records, ensuring seamless domain management and integration.

## Description

The Mailgun Kubernetes Custom Resources Operator seamlessly integrates Mailgun's email services into Kubernetes, enabling users to manage domains, webhooks, and routes directly within the cluster. By defining custom resources, the operator automates the creation and configuration of Mailgun-related settings, streamlining the management of email functionalities for applications deployed on Kubernetes.

Furthermore, when used alongside the external-dns operator, this Mailgun operator enhances functionality by automatically verifying DNS records for domains, ensuring that domain configurations are accurate and reducing manual interventions. This integration provides a robust solution for developers and DevOps teams, allowing them to automate and manage email-related tasks efficiently within their Kubernetes environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.22.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mailgun-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mailgun-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

>**NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall
**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/mailgun-operator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/mailgun-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```
